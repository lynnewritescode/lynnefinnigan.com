        <h2>Mentorship</h2>
        <p>I enjoy helping others and have worked as a mentor to various junior and graduate developers and interns throughout my career.</p>
        <p>In 2019 Iâ€™ve been a mentor to 5 interns - one per month - as part of the BIMA and TRC <a
            href="https://trcmedia.org/training/inspiring-digital-leaders/"
            aria-label="Go to the trc website to read more about the inspiring digital leaders programme"
          >Inspiring Digital Leaders programme</a>. This involved working with graduates from various different backgrounds and skillsets. The majority of the interns had no coding experience, which was both challenging and rewarding for me as a mentor. During our time together, each of them built a website and deployed it to a staging site via <a
            href="http://www.netlify.com"
            aria-label="Go to the netlify website"
          >Netlify</a>. Many of them have expressed that they want to continue learning to code, and some of them have started attending local coding meetup groups.</p>
